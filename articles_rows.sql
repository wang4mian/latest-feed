At the heart of this new machine is the Bambu Vision Encoder, an optical feedback system that delivers closed-loop motion correction for improved dimensional accuracy at speed, a feature rarely seen in desktop FFF systems. Through a program of calibration routines, dimensional benchmarks, and application tests, our engineering team assessed how this technology and the wider system around it compares with competitors in the professional desktop market. Shenzhen-based Bambu Lab has built its reputation on high-performance, automated desktop 3D printers tightly integrated with its own software ecosystem. With the H2D Pro, the company is targeting professional users who require reliable multi-material workflows and engineering-grade results. Bambu Lab H2D Pro front and side angles. Photo by 3D Printing Industry. Positioned as a dual-nozzle, production-ready platform, the H2D Pro combines tungsten-carbide nozzles, a compact dual-extrusion toolhead, and a 350 × 320 × 325 mm build volume inside an actively heated enclosure. These features are aimed at consistent throughput with abrasive and technical filaments. The machine sits within Bambu’s connected ecosystem (MakerWorld, Bambu Studio, Bambu Handy) and adds enterprise-friendly networking, including WPA2-Enterprise Wi-Fi and Ethernet. Compared with earlier Bambu machines, the Pro introduces mechanical refinements such as a foldable filament cutter, integrated nozzle wiper, reinforced AMS feed path, and automatic nozzle-offset calibration to improve reliability in multi-material jobs. In this article, we put these claims to the test through extensive benchmarks and real-world application tests. What makes the H2D Pro stand out? The H2D Pro builds on Bambu Lab’s reputation for automation and high-speed printing, but introduces several professional-grade refinements aimed at consistency and material versatility. Its dual-nozzle extruder is fitted with tungsten-carbide tips, offering extended durability and reliable performance with abrasive filaments such as PA-CF, ASA-CF, and other composite materials. The actively heated chamber, reaching up to 65 °C, allows for stable processing of technical polymers, including PA6-CF, PC, and ASA. Bambu H2D Pro toolhead and nozzles. Photo by 3D Printing Industry. Another standout component is the Bambu Vision Encoder, an optical feedback system that elevates the printer beyond the open-loop motion control common in most FFF machines. Instead of relying solely on stepper motor signals, the Vision Encoder visually tracks the toolhead’s actual position against its commanded path, enabling a form of closed-loop control. This approach addresses several common challenges in high-speed extrusion. By directly monitoring movement, the encoder can detect skipped steps, backlash, or resonance-induced drift and apply real-time corrections. This ensures that even when the printer accelerates to 20,000 mm/s² or reaches toolhead speeds of 600 mm/s, dimensional accuracy and repeatability are maintained. In practical terms, this reduces ovality in circular parts, minimizes cumulative drift in long builds, and helps preserve tight tolerances across large print jobs. Bambu Lab H2D Pro vision encoder. Photo by 3D Printing Industry. The Vision Encoder also underpins many of the H2D Pro’s automated calibration routines. It assists with gantry alignment, XY offset tuning in dual-extrusion mode, and motion accuracy checks across the full build plate. When used in combination with the printer’s toolhead camera and slicer-based compensation features, the encoder simplifies setup, improves first-layer consistency, and contributes to long-term mechanical stability without the need for manual adjustments. Calibration Interface Overview. GIF by 3D Printing Industry. Its value was most clearly demonstrated during benchmark testing. Initial circular trajectory tests showed deviations outside professional tolerances, but when paired with PLA-CF filament and Bambu Studio’s Auto Circle Contour-Hole Compensation, accuracy improved dramatically to 0.044 mm mean deviation with a 0.021 mm standard deviation. These results highlight the encoder’s role in transforming raw hardware speed into engineering-grade precision, especially in geometry-sensitive applications such as press-fits or sealing surfaces. The printer ships with both the AMS 2 Pro and AMS HT units as standard. These modules provide moisture-controlled storage, RFID-tag recognition, and automated filament switching. When chained, the system supports up to 24 spools, giving users significant flexibility in multi-material production, while minimizing manual intervention during long jobs. Bambu Lab AMS system. Photo by 3D Printing Industry. Additional refinements distinguish the Pro from earlier Bambu machines. These include a foldable filament cutter for cleaner tool changes, an integrated nozzle wiper to prevent first-layer contamination, and a reinforced AMS feed path that reduces jamming risk when using tough, fiber-reinforced filaments. Together, these updates improve uptime, material compatibility, and ease of maintenance. Design and Build: Inside the H2D Pro The H2D Pro arrives in a thoughtfully engineered package, with dual AMS units and accessories stored securely inside the build chamber. Dense foam inserts and air cushions prevent any shifting during transit, while hand slots and taped panels make lifting and setup straightforward. The full unboxing process was straightforward and only took approximately 15 minutes using only a hex key. Structurally, the 3D printer is built on a rigid steel and aluminum chassis with a CoreXY motion system capable of accelerations up to 20,000 mm/s². This ensures stability and speed, while the three-point Z-axis kinematics provide consistent bed movement across the full 325 mm build height. A glass front door and actively heated chamber (up to 65 °C) enable the successful printing of technical filaments like PA6-CF and PC, reducing warping and layer separation At the heart of the system is the dual-nozzle extruder, designed for rapid material changes and equipped with tungsten-carbide nozzles for abrasion resistance. The heated bed reaches 120°C and supports smooth and textured PEI plates, backed by automatic mesh leveling for reliable first layers. On the usability side, the Pro incorporates a 5-inch capacitive touchscreen, USB and Ethernet connectivity, and WPA2-Enterprise Wi-Fi, making it deployment-ready for professional environments. A side-mounted spool holder provides direct extrusion paths for flexible filaments such as TPU, complementing the dual AMS modules included as standard. Together, these hardware choices balance speed, durability, and accessibility, reinforcing the Pro’s positioning as a professional-grade FFF platform. Software and Workflow: Bambu Studio at the Core The H2D Pro operates within Bambu Lab’s closed software ecosystem, anchored by Bambu Studio, the company’s in-house slicing and device management platform. For this review, our team used a development edition, which included full support for the H2D Pro. Bambu Studio provides a streamlined workflow from model import to print execution. Its Prepare workspace allows users to assign materials per nozzle, configure supports, and apply modifiers, while slicing is optimized for the printer’s CoreXY architecture. Performance was responsive throughout, with slicing speeds outpacing most third-party software. A major advantage of the ecosystem is MakerWorld, Bambu Lab’s integrated library of shared and pre-configured print files. Models can be downloaded directly into Bambu Studio with pre-set orientation, supports, and material assignments, reducing preparation time. Designers can also upload their own projects, share technical notes, and receive feedback through a built-in reward system. The H2D Pro’s dual-extruder configuration is well supported, with intuitive controls for material switching, purge volume, and prime tower setup. Advanced features, such as adaptive layer height, hole/shaft compensation, ironing, and fuzzy skin, are built in for fine-tuning professional workflows. Material presets are automatically applied when RFID-tagged Bambu filaments are loaded through the AMS, minimizing user error and ensuring correct temperature and flow parameters. Monitoring and remote management are integrated through the Device tab in Bambu Studio and the Bambu Handy mobile app. Users can access real-time print statistics, view a live camera feed, adjust parameters, or even cancel jobs remotely. Cloud connectivity extends this further, though secure deployment is possible via local LAN or WPA2-Enterprise Wi-Fi. Overall, the software reinforces Bambu Lab’s “plug-and-print” philosophy. While the closed format limits G-code export for non-Bambu machines, the tight integration ensures reliability and speed for H2D Pro users. Putting the H2D Pro to the Test Our benchmarking tests combined dimensional accuracy checks, repeatability measurements, and our internal 3DPI test model, designed to evaluate consistency across common failure modes such as overhangs, bridges, and retraction. Repeatability testing of the square model. Photo by 3D Printing Industry. Repeatability tests measure how consistently a printer can reproduce the same geometry over multiple runs. We evaluated a set of standard shapes, squares, hexagons, and tubes, with a target standard deviation of ≤0.1 mm across dimensions. The H2D Pro performed well within this range, achieving deviations consistently below 0.05 mm. Z-axis performance was particularly strong, showing near-perfect layer height control. Accuracy, assessed by comparing printed dimensions to CAD values, was more geometry-dependent. For circular features such as holes and contours, our target threshold was ≤0.1 mm. In default PLA profiles, the H2D Pro tended to undershoot, with deviations of 0.1–0.15 mm. While this falls outside our benchmark tolerance, it could be corrected using Bambu Studio’s built-in compensation tools. Circular trajectory print result. Photo by 3D Printing Industry. The circular trajectory test evaluates how accurately a printer can reproduce round geometries, which is critical for parts requiring press-fits, bearing seats, or sealing surfaces. We measure ovality by comparing the printed part’s X and Y dimensions against a nominal circle. For professional FFF systems, a mean deviation of ≤0.1 mm is our target threshold for acceptable accuracy. In initial tests using default PLA profiles, the H2D Pro produced measurable ovality, with a mean deviation of 0.147 mm, outside the benchmark tolerance. After retesting with Bambu’s PLA-CF and enabling the experimental Auto Circle Contour-Hole Compensation feature in Bambu Studio, accuracy improved significantly to a mean deviation of 0.044 mm with a standard deviation of 0.021 mm. These results not only met but comfortably surpassed our target, confirming the importance of slicer compensation in realizing the full benefit of the printer’s Vision Encoder–assisted motion control. Measured process capability cylinders on Fusion. Images by 3D Printing Industry. Process capability testing evaluates whether a printer can consistently produce parts within specified tolerances. Using statistical indices (Cp, Cpk, and Cpm), we assess both the spread and centering of dimensional results against nominal CAD values. For professional FFF systems, a Cp or Cpk above 1.33 is typically considered acceptable, while values above 2.0 indicate excellent repeatability. 150 cylinder parts in the slicer and 150 3D printed cylinder parts. Image and photo by 3D Printing Industry. In our tests, the H2D Pro significantly exceeded these thresholds, achieving a Cp of 6.49 and a Cpk of 3.65, both well beyond the minimum standard for capable processes. These figures highlight the system’s ability to deliver tight, repeatable results across repeated prints. However, the Cpm value of 0.75 revealed a consistent systematic offset, meaning that while parts were dimensionally consistent, they were not always perfectly centered on the nominal CAD values. This misalignment can be addressed by applying slicer-based dimensional compensation. The Pro successfully printed unsupported overhangs up to 65°, with only minor bulging at 50°. Retraction performance was excellent, showing no visible stringing in spike tests. Bridging extended cleanly to 60 mm spans, far beyond the typical 15 mm baseline for most FFF printers. A full-height 325 mm tower printed without defects or wobble, confirming Z-axis stability, while the perimeter test validated the entire 350 × 320 mm build area with seamless nozzle transitions across the plate. Tower, overhang, and retraction test parts. Photos by 3D Printing Industry. 3DPI benchmark score To consolidate performance across categories, we apply the 3DPI benchmarking suite, a standardized set of test models that evaluates key aspects of FFF printing: repeatability, flow control, overhangs, bridging, retraction, surface quality, dimensional accuracy, and ghosting suppression. Each metric is scored individually and then combined into a weighted total out of 100. For desktop FFF printers, a score above 60/100 indicates strong overall performance, while scores above 70/100 place a system in the top tier of the market. The H2D Pro achieved a total score of 89.8/100, positioning it at the top end of desktop-class FFF machines. It excelled in repeatability, bridging, and ghosting suppression, reflecting both the rigidity of its CoreXY motion system and the corrective capabilities of the Vision Encoder. Retraction performance was also strong, with minimal stringing visible on stress tests. Benchmark test 3D printed at standard print speed. Photo by 3D Printing Industry. Overall, the Pro’s score reflects a system with exceptional mechanical stability, accuracy, and reliability, capable of handling a wide range of materials and geometries with minimal intervention. Its near-perfect result firmly establishes it among the most capable desktop FFF platforms we have tested to date. Bambu Lab H2D Pro 3DPI test results radar chart. Image by 3D Printing Industry. Real-World Applications: From Prototypes to Functional Parts Next, we evaluated the H2D Pro with a range of functional application prints spanning automotive, tooling, and flexible materials. The goal was to validate whether the machine’s specifications translate into usable components for real-world engineering workflows. Air Scoop print result. Photos by 3D Printing Industry. Following this, our team 3D printed a PET-CF winglet using HIPS as a support material. This highlighted the ability of the H2D Pro’s chamber to prevent warping when processing composite materials. The resulting part was robust enough for aerodynamic evaluation, confirming the new 3D printer’s worth for producing functional prototypes. Winglet print result. Photos by 3D Printing Industry. A larger ASA dirtbike headlight fairing was also printed. This achieved a precise fit and clean HIPS support removal, confirming dimensional accuracy on bulky geometries. Headlight fairing print result. Photos by 3D Printing Industry. Tools and workshop parts Leveraging its dual-nozzle setup, our H2D Pro next 3D printed a motorcycle clutch basket tool in PC and ASA-CF, combining transparent outer walls with fiber-reinforced inserts. The result was a cost-effective tool with visible internal reinforcement, suitable for real workshop use. Similarly, a generative-design automotive bracket in PETG and HIPS printed cleanly, validating the machine’s potential in prototyping complex geometries. Clutch tool print. Photos by 3D Printing Industry. Flexible and high-temperature materials The Pro’s side-mounted direct-feed spool holder enabled smooth handling of TPU, which can often prove problematic on Bowden-style systems. We printed a dual-TPU funnel combining 95A and 70A shore hardness filaments, confirming the toolhead’s ability to transition between flexible grades without jams or feeder slip. Layer adhesion was strong, and the funnel retained its intended elasticity, though residual moisture in the filament produced some surface bubbling, highlighting the importance of pre-drying elastomers even when using the AMS. Funnel print result. Photos by 3D Printing Industry. At the other end of the spectrum, the actively heated chamber proved critical in processing PA6-CF, a notoriously warp-prone nylon composite. We printed a full-height inlet manifold at 325 mm Z, with chamber temperature stabilized at 65 °C. The part maintained consistent adhesion across the base layers and showed no visible warping or delamination, a result difficult to achieve on unenclosed desktop printers. Surface finish was matte and uniform, and the part’s stiffness suggested it could be deployed in engine-bay conditions without deformation. Inlet manifold print. Photo by 3D Printing Industry. A Professional-Grade Platform without the price tag Bambu Lab’s H2D Pro delivers professional-grade 3D printing at a consumer-friendly price of just $3,799. In benchmarking, the 3D printer delivered excellent repeatability and strong Z-axis control. Its overall benchmark score of 89.8/100 places it among the strongest desktop FFF systems we have tested, with particular strengths in bridging, ghosting suppression, and repeatability. Stress tests confirmed overhangs up to 65°, bridges spanning 60 mm, and process capability indices far above the 1.33 industry threshold, underscoring its consistency in high-speed operation. In application testing, the H2D Pro consistently delivered reliable, application-ready components across diverse engineering scenarios. A motorcycle brake air scoop printed in PLA-CF showed clean surfaces and stable geometry, while a PET-CF winglet highlighted the chamber’s ability to suppress warping in composites. Larger parts, such as an ASA dirtbike headlight fairing, maintained dimensional accuracy with HIPS supports detaching cleanly after printing. Workshop tooling also proved viable, with a PC/ASA-CF clutch basket tool demonstrating internal reinforcement and a PETG/HIPS automotive bracket validating its ability to handle complex geometries. At the material extremes, the direct-feed spool holder enabled smooth TPU printing without jams, while the heated chamber stabilized a full-height PA6-CF inlet manifold, producing a part suitable for use in engine-bay conditions. Caveats include lengthy calibration routines, occasional oversensitivity in AI failure detection, and a footprint that may be large for smaller workspaces. Still, these drawbacks are outweighed by consistent accuracy and a generous build envelope, robust integration with Bambu Studio, and enterprise-grade networking options. For engineers, SMEs, and research groups seeking a reliable, production-ready FFF solution, the H2D Pro stands out as one of the most capable systems currently on the market. The Bambu Lab H2D Pro demonstrates a high level of engineering maturity, combining speed, automation, and material versatility in a system aimed squarely at professional users. Its dual-nozzle hotend, actively heated chamber, and AMS ecosystem make it well-suited to multi-material workflows and demanding engineering polymers. Across our tests, the H2D Pro consistently translated its specifications into functional parts with minimal post-processing. By pairing high-speed motion with the precision of its Vision Encoder, Bambu Lab has created a desktop FFF platform that bridges the gap between rapid prototyping and dependable small-batch production.

Register free for AMA: Energy and AMA: Automotive &amp; Mobility . Chennai-based private space startup AgniKul Cosmos has 3D printed what it claims to be the world’s largest single-piece 3D printed Inconel rocket engine, which has also received a US patent. Measuring about one meter in length, the engine is printed as a single integrated structure that runs from fuel inlet to exhaust without welds, joints, or fasteners. According to Times of India (TOI), the approach is intended to lower manufacturing complexity, reduce points of failure, and cut production time by more than 60%. In a LinkedIn post , Srinath Ravichandran Co-Founder &amp; CEO at AgniKul wrote, “Humbled to introduce the world’s biggest single-piece 3D-printed inconel engine, a global first in both scale &amp; complexity. This milestone marks a breakthrough in additive manufacturing at this scale &amp; comes as a major extension of our earlier accomplishment of making &amp; flying the world’s first single piece engine.” World’s largest single-piece 3D printed Inconel rocket engine. Photo via Srinath Ravichandran. AgniKul’s AM developments in private space sector This achievement builds on a series of milestones that have marked AgniKul’s progress in propulsion technology. In February 2021, the private space startup test-fired Agnilet, a semi-cryogenic engine created in a single 3D printing run . Agnilet was developed to power the firm’s Agnibaan launch vehicle, designed to carry payloads of up to 100 kg into low Earth orbits of about 700 km. At the time, AgniKul highlighted that the engine could be printed in under four days and at roughly a tenth of the cost of conventional assembly, demonstrating the potential of additive manufacturing in rocketry. To scale this approach, AgniKul established Rocket Factory-1 in July 2022 at the IIT Madras Research Park in Chennai. Described as India’s first dedicated facility for 3D printed rocket engines , the site is equipped with a 400 mm x 400 mm x 400 mm EOS metal 3D printer and systems capable of handling end-to-end production. Designed to produce up to two Agnilet engines each week, the factory marked a shift from experimental testing toward steady manufacturing capability. That capability was further demonstrated in May 2025, when AgniKul test-fired India’s first electric motor-driven semi-cryogenic rocket engine. Unlike conventional designs that use turbopumps or gas generators, the new engine employed an electric motor to circulate propellants, allowing thrust to be precisely varied by adjusting motor speed. During the test, the system was throttled across a broad range of power levels, showcasing both flexibility and reliability. Many of its subsystems were produced at Rocket Factory-1, while the associated motor drives and control software were developed in-house. The electric motor-driven engine is intended to power Agnibaan, which can be configured to carry between 30 kg and 300 kg depending on mission requirements as noted by India Today . With the grant of a US patent for its single-piece 3D printed engine, AgniKul has now secured legal protection for its design and process in the US market, underscoring the wider progression of India’s private space sector from early-stage developments toward scalable launch systems.

Photo via Business Standard. 3D printing reshapes rocket engine manufacturing One of the benefits of 3D printing is that it allows the engines to be built as fewer pieces, eliminating complex assembly while cutting production time and costs. A notable example of this was revealed when Edinburgh-based private rocket manufacturer Skyrora began full-duration testing of its updated 70 kN 3D printed rocket engine, produced using the company’s Skyprint 2 3D printers . Intended for Skyrora’s first commercial orbital launch, the new design reduced production times by 66% and costs by 20% while incorporating an improved cooling chamber to extend engine life. Running 250 seconds each to simulate mission conditions, tests evaluated life cycle and operational envelope performance. Once qualified, the engine was said to become the first commercial closed-cycle system using Hydrogen Peroxide and Kerosene, offering higher specific impulse and efficiency for the Skyrora XL orbital vehicle. Equity-funded rocket propulsion startup New Frontier Aerospace (NFA) successfully completed hot fire tests of its 3D printed Mjölnir rocket engine . The engine employed a full-flow staged combustion cycle, considered among the most efficient liquid rocket propulsion designs, making it suitable for reusable launch systems, hypersonic vehicles, and orbital transfer platforms. Fueled by liquid natural gas (LNG), it offered the potential for net carbon-negative operation when sourced from bio-waste. Supported by funding from the US Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and NASA , Mjölnir was planned for integration into NFA’s Pathfinder hypersonic VTOL UAS in 2026 and the Bifröst orbital transfer vehicle in 2027.
