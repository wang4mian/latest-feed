# express-ws
Quickly implement websocket API in express.

There are some issues with [HenningM/express-ws](https://github.com/HenningM/express-ws), the author has not been active for more than 1 year. So I created this project.

This repository is not intended to be a replacement, but to provide options to solve a problem, you can view the [differences](#differences) here.

It may provide a solution for the following problems:
- https://github.com/HenningM/express-ws/issues/157
- https://github.com/HenningM/express-ws/issues/126
- https://github.com/HenningM/express-ws/issues/52

## Features
- [x] Use directly from app.ws
- [x] http and ws of the same route can exist at the same time
- [x] Support dynamic routing
- [x] Support reading params, query parameters
- [x] Support Typescript

## how to use

``` sh
npm i @wll8/express-ws
```

``` js
const express = require(`express`)
const expressWs = require(`@wll8/express-ws`)
const {app, wsRoute} = expressWs(express())

app.ws(`/abc`, (ws, req) => {
  // const {params, query} = req
  ws.send(`abc`)
})
app.get(`/abc`, (req, res) => {
  res.json(`abc`)
})

app.listen(3040)
```
